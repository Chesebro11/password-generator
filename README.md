# Password Generator

The purpose of this projecet is to create a basic webpage that generates a password based off of user input

The program asks for what length the user wants, and then whether they want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols

if the user doesn't input a valid length (between 8 - 128) they are prompted to put in a valid length

if the user chooses to not select any of the options for letters numbers or symbols they are once again prompted to choose at least one option

This mostly focuses on javascript

Genuinely had a really fun time writing this program I ran into significantly less issues than I did with anything having to do with css :))

Written in CSS, HTML, and Javascript!
